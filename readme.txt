Four Little Warriors
--------------------


>> Introduction

Thanks for trying out Four Little Warriors.
The game was a try to create an unique game.
It features chaotic, but yet simple and intuitive gameplay.
To get most of it, gather some friends and play together.
Don't worry if you get lost the first few games, you'll get
used to the game pretty fast.



>> Goal of game

Try to get as many power crystals as possible.
Hit other players and kill golems for additional
crystals.
Add chaos to the game by collecting special items
found in wooden boxes.
Not all items are good for you. Choose wisely.



>> How to play

               - stamina (red bar)
               - ammo (blue bar - only for weapons)

Yellow player: Cursor keys  - movement
               CTRL         - attack/block

Attacking and blocking:
