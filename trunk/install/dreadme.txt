Four Little Warriors - Demo Version
-----------------------------------


>> Introduction

Thanks for trying out the new demo of Four Little Warriors.
The game was a try to create an unique game.
It features chaotic, but yet simple and intuitive gameplay.
To get most of it, gather some friends and play together.
Don't worry if you get lost the first few games, you'll get
used to the game pretty fast.
Not everybody will like this, of course. In case you're one
of those who actually liked it, I want to say thank you.



>> Goal of game

Try to get as many power crystals as possible.
Hit other players and kill golems for additional
crystals.
Add chaos to the game by collecting special items
found in wooden boxes.
Not all items are good for you. Choose wisely.



>> How to play

Player status: - Amount of crystals
               - current place
               - games already won (yellow dots)
               - stamina (red bar)
               - ammo (blue bar - only for weapons)

Yellow player: Cursor keys  - movement
               CTRL         - attack/block
Red player:    W,A,S,D      - movement
               Q            - attack/block
Blue player:   Mouse move   - turn left/right
               Mouse right  - forwards
               Mouse middle - backwards
               Mouse left   - attack/block
Green player:  Joystick 1   - movement
               Joy1 button1 - attack/block
(Control layout can be changed in the options menu)

Attacking and blocking:

Normal attack:  hit attack key once
Special attack: when stamina is maxed hit attack key twice
Block:          Keep attack key pressed (requires stamina)

The stamina amount influences strength of the attack
