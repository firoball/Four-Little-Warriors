It all started with a big thunderstorm. The floor below your feet faded away, a giant hole appeared. Without any chance to help yourself you fell into it. Everything around you got dark.
<br><br>
After a while, you awake and find yourself in a strange area. A completely different world, probably far away from home. A place lost in time, a place with different rules.
<br><br>
Suddenly you see a strange glowing in the darkness. After getting closer you spot a sword sealed in a stone. The Sword of Time. This blade is the only way to travel in time. It is the only chance to ever get back home again. But while hurrying towards it, you make a frightening discovery.<br>
You are not the only one...<br><br>

<img src="warfare.jpg" width="130" height="180" border="0" alt="" align="left" hspace="5">Now the time has come to fight your competitors. You need more power than anyone else to get hold of the Sword of Time, your only way back home. You can always count on your weapon, but soon you will notice a significant change, because it got new abilities. By hitting your competitors, you can now drain their power. But there are other methods.<br>
Since the world you've come to seems to be lost in time, there are a plenty of things you can do now. Try collecting some items found in wooden boxes and see what impact they have. Get hold of any power crystal you can find!<br>
Beware of another danger, the golems. Luckily, you can count on your special attack and your ability to block enemy attacks.<br><br>

<b>Golems</b>
</font></div>
<br>

<div align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">
<img src="golem.jpg" width="197" height="180" border="0" alt="" align="right" hspace="5">These monsters behave very strange. For an unknown reason -actually just about nothing is known of this place- they are patrolling fixed paths. These ways can be easily determined by taking care of little blue arrows on the floor. Golems are known to drain Power whenever they get the chance to touch someone else. Be aware, golems love power crystals and get stronger by eating them.<br>
There is no chance to get rid of those stone monsters. As soon as one golem dies, a new one will come out of one of the many nests immediately. Especially that makes the Lost World so dangerous.
Golems are full of crystal energy, try to kill one of them to gain more power.<br><br>
